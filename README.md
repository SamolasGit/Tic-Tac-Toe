## ✨ Features

* **Unbeatable AI:** Implements the **Minimax Algorithm**, ensuring the AI never loses.
* **Neon UI:** A high-contrast, dark-mode design with glowing CSS effects.
* **Dynamic Feedback:** Real-time game status updates (Turn, Win, Draw).

## 🧠 How the AI Works

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a recursive strategy used in decision-making and game theory. 

1.  **Exploration:** It explores all possible future moves in the game tree.
2.  **Backtracking:** It assigns a score to each outcome:
    * `+10` for an AI win.
    * `-10` for a player win.
    * `0` for a draw.
3.  **Optimal Play:** The AI chooses the move that **maximizes** its own score while **minimizing** the player's potential score.
